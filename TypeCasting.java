        Although the automatic type conversions are helpful, they will not fulfill all needs. For example, what if you want to
        assign an int value to a byte variable? This conversion will not be performed automatically, because a byte is smaller
        than an int. This kind of conversion is sometimes called a narrowing conversion, since you are explicitly making the
        value narrower so that it will fit into the target type.
